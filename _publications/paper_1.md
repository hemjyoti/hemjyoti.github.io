title: "A comparative study between a cant angle hexacopter and a conventional hexacopter"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper_1
excerpt: 'The purpose of this paper is to present a brief comparison between a conventional hexacopter and a cant angle hexacopter. A conventional hexacopter has got all its 6 rotors fixed and thrusted upwards in the body frame which gives it a decoupled 4 DOF motion or a coupled 6 DOF motion. But a cant angle hexacopter has all its six rotors canted at an angle tangentially to the radius of the frame. It provides 2 extra degree of freedom in the translational X & Y axis without any coupling. A conventional hexacopter cannot translate in X & Y axis without tilting but the cant angle hexacopter serves this purpose. In this paper we compare their dynamic models using classical Newton Euler equations and design a PD controller for simulating the vehicle dynamics.'
