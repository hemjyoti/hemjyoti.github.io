title: "Experimental Implementation of Fuzzy Vision-Based Tracking Control of Quad-Rotor"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper_3
excerpt: 'This paper presents a novel approach to detect and track an object using a quadrotor-UAV. The proposed system mainly consists of two parts- (i) Object detection and tracking using histogram backprojection and CAMSHIFT tracker, (ii) Fuzzy Proportional and Fuzzy Proportional-Derivative controller for controlling the drone. We implemented our algorithm using ROS (Robot Operating System), OPENCV library and MATLAB programming environment.'
