title: "Static performance analysis of electric propulsion system in quadrotors"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper_2
excerpt: 'This paper describes the selection of brushless motors, propellers and battery for getting maximum time of hover for a quadrotor UAV. We also introduce a experimental testbed to measure various parameters of the system like torque, thrust, RPM, current and voltage. The static testbed is directly interfaced through MATLAB for real time data acquisition. We tested different motor and propeller combinations to find the relation of their various parameters with efficiency and static coefficients.'
