title: "Dynamic inversion control of quadrotor with a suspended load"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper_5
excerpt: 'In this paper, I have tackled the problem of a quadrotor with a suspended load using nonlinear dynamic inversion method. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new dynamics of the UAV-load system using Newtonâ€™s law. I applied dynamic inversion control for directing the UAV to the desired coordinates and simultaneously minimizing the sway angle of the suspended mass. I have carried the entire simulation in the inertial frame. My approach is to use an outer loop controller for maintaining the position and an inner loop controller for the desired roll, pitch and yaw rate. I have performed the simulations on MATLAB.'
